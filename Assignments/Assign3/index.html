		  <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
		  Your project proposal will consist of the following pieces:
		  <ul>
		    <li>Project overview.
		    <li>Features list and ranking.
		    <li>Parts list.
		    <li>Resources list.
		    <li>Schedule.
		  <ul>

          <section class="main">
                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
This should be 2 to 3 paragraphs describing your project in detail.
		What does it do?  How do people interact with it?
		What are its inputs and outputs, both in terms of data
		and sensors?  Is it stationary or mobile?  How big is it?<p><p>

	      <h2>Features List and Ranking</h2>
	      List all of the things you will need to implement for
	      your project, and then sort them into three categories:
	      Necessary, Should have, and Would Be Nice.  For example, if I was implementing a
	      robot unicorn with an LED horn that detected wifi, my
	      features list might be something like: Robot chassis:
	      Necessary, WiFi detection: Necessary, LEDs light up when
	      there's wifi: Necessary,  Unicorn can walk: Should have,
	      LEDs have cool rainbow pattern:
	      Would Be Nice.  (Your feature list should be longer than
	      this, and have more details.)<p><p>

	      <h2>Parts List</h2>
	      List all of the electronics and mechanical pieces you
	      will need for your project.  We have a limited budget
	      with which to buy parts for the class, so please
	      indicate what parts you already have and what you will
	      need to purchase.  The maximum budget for parts to
	      purchase for your project is $100. Provide links to all
	      the parts you need to buy <p><p>

	      <h2>Resources List</h2>
	      Include links to any tutorials and guides you will be using, and a
	      couple sentences on how they will be useful in building
	      your project.  You should include at least three.  (For
	      example, my WiFi detecting unicorn robot would include a
	      link
	      to <a href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/hilal/unicorn-horn-with-neopixel-leds-and-arduino-lilypad-45333e">this
		LED unicorn horn</a>.)

	      <h2>Schedule</h2>
	      We will demo these projects in the last week of classes,
	      which means that after you submit this, you will
	      have <b>nine weeks</b> of classes to build your
	      project.  That's so soon!  Create a detailed schedule
	      with due dates for all of your features.  Order them so
	      necessary features are scheduled first, then should
	      have, then would be nice.<p><p>


	      <h2>Handin</h2>
	      Create a pdf that contains all of these things.  Submit
	      it as a comment on your Group Post (created last week)
	      on piazza.
