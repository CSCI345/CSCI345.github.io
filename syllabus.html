									<h2>Course Overview</h2>
								Sensor
								technologies
								and
								computers
								permeate
								our
								modern
								world,
								from
								smartphones
								to
								surveillance
								systems
								to
								automated
								machinery.
								These
								modes
								of
								physical
								computing
								create
								a
								direct
								link
								between
								human
								movement,
								touch,
								and
								computer-controlled
								technologies,
								giving
								rise
								to
								many
								avenues
								of
								interdisciplinary
								research,
								innovation,
								and
								creative
								possibilities.
								Related
								areas
								of
								practice
								and
								inquiry
								include
								embodiment
								and
								gesture
								research,
								controller/interface
								design,
								machine
								learning/AI,
								haptics,
								embedded
								systems,
								Human-Computer
								Interaction
								(HCI), and
								New
								Interfaces
								for
								Musical
								Expression
									(NIMEs).<p><p>
								    

									In
									this
									learning
									community
									we
									will
									explore
									how
									sensors
									and
									computers
									engage
									the
									physical
									world
									from
									a
									variety
									of
									perspectives.
									Through
									guest
									presentations
									and
									readings/discussion,
									we
									will
									explore
									implications
									of
									this
									“hybridization”
									between
									human
									and
									machine.
									Through
									hands-on
									projects,
									we
									will
									build
									embedded
									computer
									systems
									that
									use
									sensors
									to
									collect
									information
									about
									the
									world
									around
									them.
									In
									collaborative
									groups,
									we
									will
									create
									sensor-based
									systems
									to
									present
									at
									the
									end
									of
									the semester.<p>
									
									<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
									<ol>
                                        <li>Learn to programmatically
                                        gather data from sensors</li>
                                        <li>Learn to program arduino
                                        based embedded systems.</li>
                                        <li>Explore ways computers
                                        can interact with the world.</li>
									</ol>
									
									<h2>Course Materials</h2>

There is no textbook required for this class.  Instead, you will need
									to
									purchase
									<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D8KOZF4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">this
									arduino
									kit</a>,
									which
									we
									will
									use
									for
									labs
									throughout
									the course.<p>
									
<p>If you cannot afford this kit, the Oberlin's <a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/mrc/student-resources/funding">Emergency Book
  Fund</a> provides loans to Oberlin students to buy textbooks and
  supplies.  Students are expected to pay back these loans only when
  they are financially able.  These funds are administered through the
  Office of the Dean of Students, Wilder Hall, Room 105.  If you
  cannot afford this kit and the Emergency Book Fund does not
  work for you, please talk to me and we will figure
  something out.</p>

									
						

									<h2>Grading</h2>
									<p>Final grades will be determined as follows:</p>
									<table>
                                        <thead>
                                            <th>Component</th>

									</table>

									<h2>Group Work</h2>
								Most
								of
								your
								grade
								in
								this
								course
								will
								be
								based
								on a
								semester
								long
								group
								project.
								All
								group
								aspects
								of
								your
								grade
								will
								be
								weighted
								by
								your
								group's
								feedback
								on
								your
								effort,
								behavior
								and
								contributions
								to the
								project.
								Additionally,
								your
								group
								project
								grade
								may be
								lowered
								if you
								are
								not
								contributing
								to the
								project
								(i.e. not
								attending
								class
								for
								project
								work
								days,
								not
								making
								commits
								to
								your
								group's
								github, etc).<p>
									
									<h2>Late
									Homework
									  Policy</h2>
All group assignments must be turned in on time unless there is an
									emergency,
									and
									you
									contact
									me
									before
									the
									assignment deadline.<p>

									
									<p>Unless
									otherwise
									specified,
									each
									arduino
									lab
									will
									be
									due
									at
									10
									PM
									on
									Monday
									night
									of
									the
									week
									following
									the
									start
									of
									the
									lab
									assignment. Late
									handins
									are
									strongly
									discouraged. At
									your
									discretion,
									you
									can
									use
									up
									to
									three
									free
									"late passes", which each grant you an additional day to complete a lab assignment (more than one can be used per assignment). Please make sure you let me know in advance (i.e., before the lab deadline) when you plan on using your late passes by filling out the late day form on Blackboard.</p>

									
									<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>I am committed to making this class accessible to all students.  If
you have accessibility needs, please email me or come discuss them
  with me.  Things you might want to discuss accomodations for include
  physical and mental disabilities, both permanent and temporary, any
  situation that is causing you to not be able to attend class or
  spend as much time on this class as you would like (stress, family
  situations, work hours, just going through a rough time), not having
  access to computers, not being able to afford the textbook, anything
  that is keeping you from doing your best in this course.  Let me
  know, and we'll figure something out.
</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

Both Oberlin College and I personally value the diversity of
perspective that each of you bring to this classroom and our study of
Computer Science together.  In this class, we must all commit to
fostering a safe, inclusive and welcoming environment which will allow
all of us to learn.  Please respect the competance and hard work of
your colleagues in this classroom.  If you are made to feel
uncomfortable in class or while working on class material, please
notify me so we can take steps to address the situation.  Students who
are disruptive to class and our learning community will face
consequences including potentially being removed from the course. <p>


									
									<h2>Academic Dishonesty</h2>
									<p>Students are expected to adhere to the <a href="https://new.oberlin.edu/office/dean-of-students/honor/students.dot">Oberlin College Honor Code</a>. Any violations will be reported to the Honor Code Committee.</p>
	

									<p>For every assignment, students must indicate whether they followed the Honor Code in completing the assignment. If so, students should end each assignment by writing:</p>
									<blockquote>I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment.</blockquote>
