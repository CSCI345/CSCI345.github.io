                <ul>
                	<li>Think about the art museum as a

                 </ul>


		<p>To complete this lab, you will need:
		  <ul>
		    <li>A computer.
		    <li>The Allen Memorial database.
		    <li>The art museum.
		      </ul>

		    <h2>Part 0 - Groups</h2>
We will be doing this project in groups of 3 to 4 people. One person
		    in your group must bring a laptop with them to the
		    museum.  You must
		    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ay-EPOC99gEs5OUQDLURtIokJ_pXuCkc4WvTXGrNaRU/edit?usp=sharing">sign
		      up your group here</a>.  Your group will submit
		      one assignment with answers to the questions below.<p><p>  

		      You will need to bring a copy of
		      the <a href="./CS345artmuseum.csv">art museum
		      database</a> on your laptop to the museum.
		      
		    
                      <h2>Part 1 - Look at the Art</h2>
First, look at the museum database, and familiarize yourself with the
		      column headings.  Then, wander around the art
		      museum a little bit, and come up with an answer
		      for the following question.<p>

		      
		  <div class="box">
		    <b>1.</b> How is the art currently arranged?  Pick
		    two columns from the database that you think
		    represent the current ordering/grouping of art
		    within the museum, and explain why you chose them.
		    </div>


		  <section class="main">
                <h2>Part 2 - Rearrange the Art</h2>
Your group has been assigned one of the columns in the database.
		(Look
		at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ay-EPOC99gEs5OUQDLURtIokJ_pXuCkc4WvTXGrNaRU/edit?usp=sharing">the
		  google doc</a> to find out which.)  Using the
		information in your column, explore the art museum to
		find interesting pieces.<p><p>


		Imagine you are
		rearranging the art museum to be organized by your
		column, instead of its current organization.  Design
		an exhibit of ten pieces that illustrate something
		about your column.  You can pick ten pieces that all
		have the same property, or that illustrate differences
		within your column heading.  <p><p>

		Use <a href="http://allenartcollection.oberlin.edu/emuseum/">the
			art museum website</a> to find images of all
			the pieces you are using in your exhibit, and
			create a visual representation of how you
		would arrange your pieces.<p><p>

<div class="box">
<b>2.</b> Why did you pick these pieces?  What do they illustrate about
    your database column?
    </div>
		
              </section>

 <section class="main">
                <h2>Part 3 - Redesign the Database</h2>
	
Have each member of your group pick a different piece of art.  Compare the experience of looking at it with
		what the database says about the piece.<p>

		
		<div class="box">
		  <b>3.</b> What column(s) are missing from the
		  database?  What would need to be added to fully
		  capture the art? How was this illustrated in the
		  pieces you looked at?  (Note: The database currently also
		  has images of the art, which were ommitted from our
		  copy for file size.)

                <h2>Handin</h2>
                
                <p> You will submit your assignment by posting a
                comment on the piazza thread for lab 2.  Your post
                should include a link to a pdf with the answers to all
              three questions, and the visual representation of your exhibit.
                </p>
