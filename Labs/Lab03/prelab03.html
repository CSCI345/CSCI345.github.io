									In this prelab you will formulate some of the ideas necessary to complete Lab 03. Please turn in your solution on <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a>.  You can either turn it in as a PDF (e.g., saving a document as a PDF in Word), take a picture (e.g., with a smartphone), or scan it (e.g., at the library) to hand it in.  Please remember, no late prelabs allowed!

								<p>In the lab proper, you'll be using graphical primitives (rectangles, circles, lines, etc.) to create an image of your own choosing.</p>

								<div class="box">

								  use
								  as a

								  your

								  Some

								  a
								  cityscape;
								  a
								  unicorn
								  fighting
								  a
								  robot;
								  happy

								  Your

								<h2>Monte Carlo!</h2>
                <p>
                You probably remember bumping into that peculiar number &pi; = 3.14159265..., right? 
                It comes up when you're talking about circles and trigonometry, but also appears in a 
                bunch unexpected places that seem to have little to do with either. As a refresher, Pi 
                can be defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference (&pi; d) to its diameter (d).  
                One interesting feature of Pi is that it's an <i>irrational number</i>, meaning it 
                cannot be expressed as a fraction m/n where both m and n are integers; consequently, 
                its decimal representation never ends or even repeats.  In fact, we can make a stronger 
                statement about Pi: it is a <i>transcendental number</i>, which means that there is no 
                polynomial with rational coefficients of which Pi is a root. But, I digress.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Since ancient times, mathematicians have been fascinated with the study of Pi and it's 
                properties.  Early approximations of Pi, such as 22/7 and 355/113 were accurate to 3 and 
                7 digits repsectively (the latter approximation was the best known for nearly a 
                millenium).  Currently, more than the first trillion (a million million) digits are 
                known. There are many ways to estimate Pi -- for example, you could draw as precise a 
                circle as you can manage, measure its circumference C and diameter d, and then divide 
                C/d; this should give you Pi. Alternatively, there is a geometry-based approach due to 
                Archimedes. We'll investigate a third approach using what is called a <em>Monte Carlo</em> 
                method.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Monte Carlo Method</h3>
                <p>
                When we say we're using a Monte Carlo method, we usually mean we're going to do a bunch of 
                random trials and observe the fraction of those trials that have a certain property.  
                In our case, we're going to be throwing darts into a square region, and computing the 
                fraction of those darts that land within a circle inscribed inside that square.  Each 
                throw is a trial, and the property we are concerned with is whether or not the dart 
                landed inside the circle or not.
                </p>
                
                <table>
                  <tbody>
                    <tr>
                      <td width="200px"><b>Describe the Problem:</b></td>
                      <td>The problem you will solve on your lab is as follows.<br/><br/>
                        <b>Input:</b> get a number of trials <tt>n</tt> from the user.<br/>
                        <b>Goal:</b> compute and output an approximation to Pi using a Monte Carlo method with <tt>n</tt> trials.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td width="200px"><b>Understand the Problem:</b></td>
                      <td>More precisely, we'll begin by (theoretically) constructing a target circle inscribed in a square. This is our dart board, and the target circle reaches all the way to the edge of the square. It might look something like the following:<br/><br/>
                        <p class="centered"><img src="target.jpg" alt="Pi Target"></p>
                        Next, we'll simulate repeatedly throwing darts at random against the board above (we'll assume that our random throws always hit the square, and are equally likely to land at  any given point inside the square). We then look at the fraction of the darts that land  within the circle out of all those that were thrown.  I claim that if we then multiply this fraction by 4, we should have a good approximation to Pi.  What sort of dark sorcery is this?  Let's take a closer look.<br/><br/>
                        Suppose you are throwing darts at the square board. Assuming it lands on the board, the chance that any one dart is inside the circle is the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square. So, if the circle had area 90 and the square area 100 (not possible, but humor me), you'd have a 90% chance of hitting the circle.
