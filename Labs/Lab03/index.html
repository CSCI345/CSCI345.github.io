                          <ol class="padded">

                                <br/><br/>
                                <pre><code>
  import picture
                                </code></pre>
                              </li>
                              
                              <li style="text-align:justify">To get started, you need to declare and initialize a new <tt>picture</tt> object using a constructor function as follows:
                                <br/><br/>
                                <pre><code>
  canvas = picture.Picture(600, 800)
                                </code></pre>
                                
                                This creates a new <tt>picture</tt> object called <tt>canvas</tt> which you'll be able to draw upon and display.  The parameters are a pair of integers that specify the width and height of the canvas.  Naturally, you can use other values if needed.                     
                              </li>
                              <br/>
                              
                              <li style="text-align:justify">
                                At any given time, picture object keeps track of an outline color (lines and edges of shapes) and a fill color (the inside of shapes).  The default values of these parameters are black and white, respectively. To change the color of the lines, you'd use the <tt>setOutlineColor</tt> function, as follows:
                                <br/><br/>
                          
                                <pre><code>
  canvas.setOutlineColor(r, g, b)
                                </code></pre>
                          
                                Here <tt>r</tt> is an expression indicating how much red the pen color should have (from 0 to 255).  Similarly, <tt>g</tt> and <tt>b</tt> indicate how much green and blue are in the pen color.  Some useful (r,g,b) values: (255, 255, 0) is yellow, (0, 0, 0) is black, and (0, 255, 255) is cyan.
                                <br/><br/>
                          
                                The function to set the fill color is what you might expect:
                                <br/><br/>
                                
                                <pre><code>
  canvas.setFillColor(r, g, b)
                                </code></pre>
                              </li>
                              
                              <li style="text-align:justify">
                                You'll also want to use the <tt>drawRect</tt> and <tt>drawRectFill</tt> function to draw rectangles and filled rectangles.  For example,
                                <br/><br/>
                          
                                <pre><code>
  canvas.drawRectFill(x, y, w, h)
                                </code></pre>
                          
                                would draw a filled rectangle in the current pen color.  The rectangle would be <tt>w</tt> pixels wide and <tt>h</tt> pixels tall.  The upper left corner of the rectangle would be located at position (<tt>x</tt>,<tt>y</tt>).  (Recall that the <tt>picture</tt> coordinate system, (0,0) is the upper left pixel.)
                              </li>
                              <br/>
                              
                              <li style="text-align:justify">
                                On older systems, you <em>might</em> need to use the <tt>display()</tt> function after you've created the image.  So you'd write
                                <br/><br/>
                          
                                <pre><code>
  canvas.display()
                                </code></pre>
                          
                                As you may recall from class, the picture window will close as soon as your program ends, so if you want to be able to admire your creation, you'll need to force the program to wait.  The easiest way to do this is by ending your program with an input statement:
                                <br/><br/>
                          
                                <pre><code>
  input()
                                </code></pre>
                                <br/>
                                Now when you run your program, it will open the picture window and keep it open until you press enter. 
                              </li>
                            </ol>
                          </div>
                          
                        Here are a few of the additional things you can do:
                        <br/><br/>
                
                        <ul>
                          <li><tt>setPenWidth(w)</tt> sets the pen and border width</li>
                          <li><tt>setPosition(x,y)</tt> sets the pen position</li>
                          <li><tt>setDirection(theta)</tt> and <tt>rotate(theta)</tt> changes the direction of the pen</li>
                          <li><tt>drawForward(d)</tt> draws a line of the current color with current width in the current direction for the specified distance</li>
                          <li><tt>drawCircle(x,y,r)</tt>, <tt>drawCircleFill(x,y,r)</tt>, <tt>drawRect(x,y,w,h)</tt>, <tt>drawRectFill(x,y,w,h)</tt>, etc. draw shapes, filled or not.</li>

                <h2>Part 2 - Monte Carlo!</h2>
                <p><tt>monte.py</tt>: 14 points</p>
                <p>You probably remember bumping into that peculiar number &pi; = 3.14159265..., right? It comes up when you're talking about circles and trigonometry, but also appears in a bunch unexpected places that seem to have little to do with either. As a refresher, Pi can be defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference (&Pi; d) to its diameter (d).  One interesting feature of Pi is that it's an <i>irrational number</i>, meaning it cannot be expressed as a fraction m/n where both m and n are integers; consequently, its decimal representation never ends or even repeats.  In fact, we can make a stronger statement about Pi: it is a <i>transcendental number</i>, which means that there is no polynomial with rational coefficients of which Pi is a root. But, I digress.</p>
                
                <p>Since ancient times, mathematicians have been fascinated with the study of Pi and it's various properties.  Early approximations of Pi, such as 22/7 and 355/113 were accurate to 3 and 7 digits repsectively (the latter approximation was the best known for nearly a millenium).  Currently, more than the first trillion (a million million) digits are known. There are many ways to estimate Pi &mdash; for example, you could draw as precise a circle as you can manage, measure its circumference C and diameter d, and then divide C/d; this should give you Pi. Alternatively, there is a geometry-based approach due to Archimedes. We'll investigate a third approach using what is called a <em>Monte Carlo</em> method.</p>
                
                <h3>Monte Carlo Method</h3>
                <p>When we say we're using a Monte Carlo method, we usually mean we're going to do a bunch of random trials and observe the fraction of those trials that have a certain property.  In our case, we're going to be throwing darts into a square region, and computing the fraction of those darts that land within a circle inscribed inside that square.  Each throw is a trial, and the property we are concerned with is whether or not the dart landed inside the circle or not.</p>

                      <td width="200px"><h4>Understand the Problem:</h4></td>
                      <td>More precisely, we'll begin by (theoretically) constructing a target circle inscribed in a square. This is our dart board, and the target circle reaches all the way to the edge of the square. It might look something like the following:<br/><br/>
                        <p class="centered"><img src="target.jpg" alt="Pi Target"></p>
                        
                        Next, we'll simulate repeatedly throwing darts at random against the board above (we'll assume that our random throws alway hits the square, and are equally likely to land at any given point inside the square). We then look at the fraction of the darts that land within the circle out of all those that were thrown.  I claim that if we then multiply this fraction by 4, we should have a good approximation to Pi.  What sort of dark sorcery is this?  Let's take a closer look.<br/><br/>
                        
                        The area of a square is the length of a side squared. Thus our square, with sides of length 2, has an area of 4. The area of a circle is Pi times the radius squared, so for a unit circle (with radius 1), the area is Pi. Therefore, the ratio of the area of our circle to the area of our square is precisely Pi/4. (That is, the circle takes up a Pi/4 portion of our dart board.)<br/><br/>
                        
                        Since each dart lands at a random location in the square, the probability that any one dart lands within the circle should be exactly the fraction of the square taken up by the circle: Pi/4. Thus, if we repeat this experiment over and over again, we'd expect roughly a Pi/4 fraction of the darts to land in the circle. By counting up the fraction that actually land in the circle in our experiments, we've gotten a probabilistic estimate for Pi/4, or a quarter of Pi. If we just multiply that estimate by 4, we've got our approximation for Pi itself. Restating our discussion as a formula, we have <br/><br/>
                
                        <p class="centered"><img src="eqn.gif" style="height: 3em;" alt=""></p>
                        
                        That is, if you throw lots of darts and keep track of the fraction that land inside the circle, multiplying this fraction by 4 should give you an approximate value for Pi. Of course, it is only an approximation: suppose (by some cosmic fluke) that all the darts thrown land near the upper left corner, outside of the circle. Then your approximation for Pi would be 0 (a rather weak estimate). However, as the number of trials increases, the likelihood that your estimate is good increases as well. <br/><br/>
                        A run of the program might appear as follows.<br/><br/>

                        In order to implement your pseudocode, you'll need to "throw a dart." Each dart's position is specified by an (x,y) coordinate, so to "throw" a dart, you just need to randomly generate two values for each dart throw (one for x and one for y). <br/><br/>

                          Python has a module that will let you generate random numbers called <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.0/library/random.html">random</a>. To use it you need to:<br/><br/>

                            <li style="text-align:justify">You can get a random integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive) with the following call

                              Another way to get the same result is with the following call:
                              <pre><code>rInt = random.randint(0,99)</code></pre>
                              
                            <li style="text-align:justify">In order to generate a random integer between 0 and 399 (which you'll do for each of the x- and y-coordinates of each dart throw), do the following.
                              <pre><code>randX = random.randint(0, 399)  # randX is between 0 and 399 </code></pre></li>
                          </ol>
                        </div>
                        
                        To display your dart throw, you can draw a small circle centered at your (randX, randY) point that you just randomly chose (please use a color that can be seen on top of the blue big circle).
                        <br/><br/>
                        Now that you have your dart throw, your next question should be: how do I know if I've hit the target? You'll do this by calculating the distance from the center of the circle to the dart and determining if it is within circle's radius and therefore inside the circle.  We did this on the <a href="prelab03.html">prelab</a>, and to help, the distance formula is given by: <br/><br/>
                        <p class="centered"><img src="circleEuclidian.png" style="height: 2.5em" alt="distance formula" class="equation"></p>
                        So to find out how far a dart lands from the origin, we need a square root, which requires the math module.<br/><br/>
                        <div class="box">
                          <a name="Math"></a>
                          <h4>Math module</h4>
                          You can gain access to the math module by including the statement:
                          <pre><code>import math</code></pre>
                          at the beginning of your program.  This will give you access to more advanced mathematical functions as well as a decent value of Pi. In particular, 
                          <pre><code>math.sqrt(exp)</code></pre>
                          will return the square root of the expression <tt>exp</tt>, and 
                          <pre><code>math.pi</code></pre>
                          is a constant representing the value of Pi.  See the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.0/library/math.html">online documentation</a> for more details, if you need them.
                        </div>
                        Now in your for loop, you can check whether the dart lands within the unit circle with the following block of code (called an <i>if-statement</i>):<br/><br/>
                        <pre><code>
 if dist < RADIUS: 
    # the body of this if-statement will only be run
    # if the distance between (randX,randY) and the center of the circle is at most RADIUS
    # (that is, if your point (randX,randY) is inside the circle.)
    # So. What do you want to do when you hit the target?
                        </code></pre>  
                        You do not have to calculate the percentage difference between your approximation and Python's <tt>math.pi</tt>, but it might be interesting to look at.
                        
                        <br/><br/>

            	          So we can rewrite the algorithm as:

            	          But drawing row i of the pyramid is a whole process in itself.  To draw row i of the pyramid, we need to answer the following questions(which you answered on your <a href="prelab03.html">prelab</a>):
          	            <ul>
          	              <li>How many bricks does the <tt>i</tt>-th row have (given that the <tt>0</tt>-th row has <tt>n</tt> bricks and the <tt>(n-1)</tt>-st row has <tt>1</tt>)? That is, <tt>numBricks<sub>i</sub> = ???</tt> Write down your answer.</li>
          	              <li>What is the side length <tt>s</tt> of each brick in terms of <tt>width</tt> and <tt>n</tt>? That is, <tt>s = ???</tt>  Write down your answer.</li>
          	            </ul>
          	            
            	          If we take another look at our pseudocode, it would look like this:
            	          <br/><br/>
                      	<div class="box">
                      	  For each row <tt>i</tt> from <tt>0</tt> to <tt>n-1</tt> do

            	          If we were to implement this pseudocode, we would see that all the rows would be squished up against the left-hand side of the canvas... that is, we haven't taken into account that each row itself starts a little bit further to the right than the row below it. Thus, our next questions (which you answered on your <a href="prelab03.html">prelab</a>):
                      	<ul>
            	            <li>What is the x-coordinate of the first brick of row <tt>i</tt> in terms of <tt>s</tt> and <tt>i</tt> (given that the <tt>0</tt>-th row starts at x-coord <tt>0</tt>)? That is, <tt>startX = ???</tt> Write down your answer.</li>

                            <li>All the bricks you draw should be exactly the same size.  While you can pass floats to various picture functions, including drawRectFill, in the end these values end up being rounded to integers (since all pixels have integer coordinates).  To ensure your bricks are placed exactly as you intend, you may wish to do the rounding yourself.</li>

                            <li>On a related note, sometimes the brick size length won't divide evenly into the canvas size. In these cases, you will have gaps either to the right or to the top of the pyramid. This is okay. However, you should <i>not</i> have gaps to the left or on the bottom of the pyramid. <b>Always start at the bottom left</b>, putting the next brick right next to theprevious one and right on top of the previous layer.</li>

                        <td>Try running the program with the examples given above as well as some others. Make sure you have gaps where you ought to, and that there aren't gaps where there shouldn't be gaps! Your pyramid should not be sloping to one side or floating in the middle. You shouldn't have some bricks that are larger than others.  If it looks fishy, go back and examine your math equations, checking that the "integer division" is being used appropriately.
                          <br/><br/>
                          Don't forget to let the user input the width and number of bricks, if you were testing the program with hard-coded values.
